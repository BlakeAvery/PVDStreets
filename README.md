# PVDStreets
JWU Computer Science 2 Final Project

A simulation of the streets of downtown Providence, RI.

This repo is for the C code associated with the project. There may be python as well.

This did not work very well by the way, don't go stealing it and then getting mad at me when it doesn't work out of the box
